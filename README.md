# Helicopter Game (Allegro 5)

This is a 2D side-scrolling helicopter game built in C++ using the Allegro 5 graphics library. The objective is to control a helicopter through a scrolling environment, avoiding obstacles and surviving for as long as possible. This project demonstrates basic physics, graphics rendering, and keyboard input handling in a game loop.

## Overview

- Developed in C++ with Allegro 5
- Simple physics-based movement (gravity + upward thrust)
- Side-scrolling gameplay
- Real-time obstacle avoidance
- Score increases with time survived

---

## Controls

- **UP Arrow Key**: Apply thrust and move the helicopter upward
- **Release Key**: Helicopter descends due to gravity
- **Avoid obstacles** to keep playing
- **Game ends** on collision

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, etc.)
- Allegro 5 installed (must link the required libraries)
- IDE like Visual Studio (recommended), Code::Blocks, or CLion

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NivedhN160/HelicopterGame-with-helicopter-drawn-using-Allegro5.git
